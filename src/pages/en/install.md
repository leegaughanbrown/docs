## Activate your license

You will find the OxyProps menu in your WordPress admin left menu, just below Oxygen (depending on your dashboard setup, the position may vary).

Click on `OxyProps` to open the license activation form.

- Enter your license key exactly as it appears in your user account.
- Enter your the email address you used when purchasing your license.
- Click the `Agree & Activate License` button.

> ⚠️ When entering your license key, please take care of avoiding preceding or trailing spaces that would result in an invalid license key response.
